A dockerized REST API that will forward notifications sent through HTTP to messaging services like Telegram, Discord or Slack.

# IMPORTANT

This project is not maintained anymore and the repository is being archived. The reason why is because this was trying to implement what [Apprise](https://github.com/caronc/apprise) is already doing.
So use [Apprise](https://github.com/caronc/apprise) instead, since it is a more mature project.
